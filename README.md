# LuMongo
=============
## Distributed Realtime Search With Lucene


LuMongo is a real-time distributed search and storage system based on Lucene. LuMongo is designed from the ground up to scale both vertically and horizontally across servers. LuMongo
stores Lucene indexes directly into MongoDB.  Documents can be stored natively into MongoDB.  When stored natively document can be queried as normal
out of MongoDB and use of [Map-Reduce](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/map-reduce/) and the [Aggregation Framework](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/aggregation-introduction/) is possible.</p>


## LuMongo is:
* Realtime
* Distributed
* Pure Java
* Open Source

## LuMongo supports:
* Sorting
* Faceting
* Searching multiple indexes with a single query
